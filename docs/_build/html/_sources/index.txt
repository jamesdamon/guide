TIND Technologies` administration guide
###################################################

Welcome to TIND Technologiesâ€™ documentation on Invenio. This documentation is divided into three different parts:

- The first guide is meant for librarians and repository managers who do not have access as system administrators. The subjects are categorized by the different tasks that librarians and managers will conduct. This guide is developed by TIND with customers of TIND in focus. Therefore, some of the descriptions are for workflows and features which is not yet publicly released.  

- The second guide is meant for system administrators who are gonna configure the system. The subjects are categorized after the different modules in Invenio. This guide is cloned from the "Admin`s Guide" at invenio.readthedocs.org. All credit goes to the Invenio community. We strive to keep this guide up-to-date with the current version at invenio.readthedocs.org to all times.

- The third guide describes tools developed by TIND to provide extra value to the users of Invenio.  


This guide is work in progress and some sites will miss information.
