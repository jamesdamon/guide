Manage Circulation
==================

Invenio features a circulation module which allow the library to manage their physical 
items, manage patron loans- and borrower information, and keep track of interlibrary loans- 
and new purchases. The module can handle multiple internal and external libraries.

Librarians who have access will find it in the administration menu.

configuration settings.

Circulation statistics are found in a the statistic module of Invenio. 

1. Managing items
-----------------

The items is the core of the circulation module. An item is attached to a bibliographic 
record and may contain multiple physical copies. The bibliographic data on top left side 
is extracted from the bibliographic metadata, while additional information, such as barcode,
location, document type, and which library it belongs to, is added to each single copy.

The item site gives an overview over current and historical overviews (hold requests, loans,
purchases), allow for updating and adding new copies, as well as creating loans and hold 
requests for specific copies.

field is mandatory while the open text fields are optional. All internal libraries will be

   step in the workflow. See :ref:`section three <table-create-request>` for a complete 
   guide of how to register new requests.

1.6. Search for items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

here are two ways of searching for an item: 



2. Create loan
--------------

.. _table-create-loan:

By selecting the button "edit basket" you are able to change the name, topic and manage 
group or public sharing rights.



The user makes the basket public by changing the global sharing rights from "No rights" to
"View record". Selecting the sub-choices "view comments" or "view comments and 
add comments" gives the public additional rights accordingly.

When the basket is made publicly accesible, a link to the url is found in the 
bottom left corner. This url is persistent and can be shared with friends and colleagues. 



4. Create request
--------------------------------------------

.. _table-create-request:

A person can get access to another users public basket by either been handed the url, or 
by searching in the search interface of the basket module. The user will then search in
the metadata of the content.

By clicking on the name of the basket, the user are sent to the public site for that basket. 

The user can now choose to subscribe for the basket itself, or set up a RSS feed based
on the content in the basket.

If the user select to subscribe for the basket, the user have access to it through basket,
under the tab "Public baskets".
