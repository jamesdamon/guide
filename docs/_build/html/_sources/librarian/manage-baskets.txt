Manage baskets
==============

Invenio features a function which allows users to store content of interest in a personal 
basket. A user can export the content from the basket in the regular
export formats, create RSS feeds, or share the content by sharing the basket in a group or 
by making the basket publicly available for all users. 


1. Create a personal basket
---------------------------

A user's personal basket is found in the menu "Personalize".

The user is asked to create a topic and a basket. Topic and baskets follow a mother-child 
hierarchy, where there can be several baskets in one topic.

The user makes the basket public by changing the global sharing rights from "No rights" to
"View record". Selecting the sub-choices "view comments" or "view comments and 
add comments" gives the public additional rights accordingly.

When the basket is made publicly accesible, a link to the url is found in the 
bottom left corner. This url is persistent and can be shared with friends and colleagues.
