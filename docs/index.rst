Invenio documentation
=====================

..


Welcome to TIND Technologies's documentation.  This documentation is divided into
different parts.  We recommend that you get started with
:ref:`first-steps` and then head over to the :ref:`quickstart`.
Besides the quickstart, there is also a more detailed :ref:`tutorial` that
shows how to create a complete application with Invenio.  If
you'd rather dive into the internals of Invenio, check out
the :ref:`api` documentation.  Common patterns are described in the
:ref:`patterns` section.
